# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi there! My name is Swaroop Bhagwat, and I'm currently a third-year Information Technology student with a passion for development. I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to make people's lives easier and solve real world problems.

I have been learning various front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I have also been exploring back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express.js to create robust and scalable server-side applications.

In my free time, I enjoy attending tech events, learning and connecting with others in the industry and as a creative part I love composing music. I am excited about the possibilities that a career in IT can offer and am eager to see where my skills and interests will take me.
